The given code was compiled in IntelliJ IDEA. 
I have taken 20 unsorted nodes and sorted them by using the swapping method.
The swapping method used here is the selection sort which was discussed in the class.
I have done both the addition and removal of the nodes in the same function.
The getter and setter methods are created for help.
The traversal of the list are being done by the toString() method.
The image has been attached which gives for random 20 values (The random library was used for the same).
We have taken values between 0 and 50.
I have added the null value to show the end of the list.

to run the code use the command in the directory of the code:-
javac main.java
java main
